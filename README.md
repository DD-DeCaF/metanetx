## Development

Run `make setup` first when initializing the project for the first time. Type
`make` to see all commands.

### Source files

The MetaNetX source files are stored in `data/`.

Reaction names are not part of MetaNetX, but collected manually by running
`./scripts/generate_reaction_names.py`. Note that the script takes several hours
to complete. Names are retrieved from cross referenced databases (currently
BiGG, kegg, ModelSEED and EC numbers are checked).

### Environment

Specify environment variables in a `.env` file. See `docker-compose.yml` for the
possible variables and their default values.

* Set `ENVIRONMENT` to either
  * `development`,
  * `testing`, or
  * `production`.
* `SECRET_KEY` Flask secret key. Will be randomly generated in development and testing environments.
* `SENTRY_DSN` DSN for reporting exceptions to
  [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/python/integrations/flask/).
* `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Comma-seperated list of CORS allowed origins.
